Original Illustrator and exported JPG / PDF files

This repository holds the original, editable master .ai (Adobe Illustrator) file for the Service Development Phases graphic, 
first shared in the GOV.UK Slack ('standard-assessments' channel). 

All colours used are taken from the GOV.UK Design System colour palette. 

The JPG is a high resolution RGB file that should be first optimised to 72 dpi before being used onscreen. 

The PDF is the most suitable for hardcopy print and it is outlined, so should reproduce clearly at any size. 

All icons are bespoke and therefore not subject to copyright.
